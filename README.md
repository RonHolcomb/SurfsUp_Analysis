# Analysis Overview

In this challenge we had to analyze the weather data for the months of June and December inorder to get a better idea of the year long weather patterns on the island. With this data we can determine if this is a worthwhile investment year round or only a summer time get away. We'll also be able to determine good business ideas and promotions during times with less rain.

# Results

Based on the analysis we can determine the following

* There was less rainy days recorded in the month of December than the month of June
* Though there were less rainy days in December the amount of rain recorded was about the same for both months
* Based on this data we can expect the same weather patterns year round

# Summary

After the analysis we can determine that the amount of rain that the island gets will be about the same all year. That being said some months experience less days of rain than others. We can take advantage of this by promoting people to use our business more than usual during these less rainy months. Although this is a good business plan we can take it a step further. If we do an analysis on which stations recorded the most and least rain we can determine exactly which specific spot on the island is the best place to set up shop. It would also help to query more temperature data. With it we can see which areas are the hottest and most in need of our ice cream service.
